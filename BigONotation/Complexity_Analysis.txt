TIME COMPLEXITY:
> Amount of tyme it takes to run an algorithm
> Algorithm runs fast, better time complexity.


SPACE COMPLEXITY:
>Amount of extra space our algorithm requires
>Algorithm takes less space, better space complexity

 ---------- DESCRIPTION                          ----------
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or
complexity of an algorithm. Big O is used to describe the Execution time Required
or the space used( eg. in memory or disk) by and algorithm. 

To measure the effiency of and algorithm, we need to consider two things
Time Complexity: How much time does it take to run completely

it's like math except it's and awesome concept to understand, not boring kind of math


                                        GIB O 
----> It doesn't depends on time, it depends on how many steps we are performing
----> The main focus is to calculate the amount of work we do or the numbers of comparisons we perform

Langue using how long an algorithms or a function takes to run.
Depens more on its actual code  is operations and comparisons than the hardware and software
